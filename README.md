**Last project for YH-Utbildning Cloud Developer 2023**


## Project Description

The goal of this project is to have your own application for family members activities planing through the week or the entire month.

This repository is based on my final capstone project for the “Cloud Developer 2023” program (YH-Utbildning). With the main focus being the deployment strategy using Terraform and Kubernetes. You will be able to implement the deployment on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).

For now the project is a simple monolithic .Net MVC application designed to use a local PostgreSQL database, this will be changed in the near future.
